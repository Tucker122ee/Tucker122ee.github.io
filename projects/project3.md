![Project Screenshot](../images/project3.png)

## Overview
A simulated incident response exercise designed to test and improve the organization's ability to detect, analyze, and respond to security incidents.

## Scenario
A simulated ransomware attack affecting critical systems and data.

## Objectives
- Test incident detection capabilities
- Evaluate response procedures
- Identify gaps in the incident response plan
- Improve team coordination and communication

## Tools Used
- SIEM for event correlation
- EDR for endpoint visibility
- Forensic tools for analysis
- Communication and collaboration platforms

## Key Findings
- Delayed detection due to insufficient monitoring rules
- Incomplete documentation of response procedures
- Communication challenges between teams
- Lack of pre-defined decision-making authority

## Recommendations
- Enhance monitoring rules for faster detection
- Document and regularly update response playbooks
- Establish clear communication channels
- Conduct regular tabletop exercises

## Outcomes
The simulation led to significant improvements in the organization's incident response capabilities and preparedness.
