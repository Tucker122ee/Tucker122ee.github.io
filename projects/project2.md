## Overview
A comprehensive vulnerability assessment of a web application, identifying security weaknesses and providing remediation recommendations.

## Assessment Scope
- Authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Input validation and sanitization
- Session management
- Data protection and encryption
- Error handling and logging

## Tools Used
- OWASP ZAP
- Burp Suite
- Nmap
- Custom scripts

## Key Findings
- SQL injection vulnerabilities in search functionality
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) in user input fields
- Insecure direct object references
- Missing security headers

## Recommendations
- Implement parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Add input validation and output encoding
- Implement proper access control checks
- Add security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.)

## Impact
The assessment helped the organization identify and fix critical vulnerabilities before they could be exploited by malicious actors.
