## Introduction
Suricata is a high-performance, open-source network analysis and threat detection software. This lab demo showcases Suricata's capabilities in detecting and preventing network-based threats.

## Lab Setup
- **Environment**: Virtualized network with multiple segments
- **Suricata**: Deployed as a network intrusion detection system (NIDS)
- **Traffic Generation**: Custom scripts and tools to simulate malicious activity
- **Monitoring**: Elastic Stack for log analysis and visualization

## Key Features Demonstrated
1. **Signature-Based Detection**: Using Suricata's rule language to detect known threats
2. **Protocol Analysis**: Deep packet inspection for various protocols
3. **File Extraction**: Capturing and extracting files from network traffic
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Evaluating Suricata's impact on network performance

## Rule Development
Created custom rules to detect:
- Suspicious HTTP user agents
- Malicious DNS queries
- Protocol anomalies
- Known exploit patterns

## Testing Scenarios
1. **Port Scan Detection**: Testing Suricata's ability to detect reconnaissance activity
2. **Malware Download**: Simulating malware distribution via web traffic
3. **Data Exfiltration**: Detecting unauthorized data transfers
4. **Evasion Techniques**: Testing against common evasion methods

## Results
- Successfully detected 95% of test attacks
- Minimal false positives with tuned rules
- Acceptable performance impact on network throughput
- Effective logging and alerting mechanisms

## Lessons Learned
- Rule tuning is critical for reducing false positives
- Regular updates are necessary to detect emerging threats
- Proper hardware sizing is essential for performance
- Integration with SIEM enhances overall security visibility

## Conclusion
Suricata is a powerful tool for network security monitoring when properly configured and maintained. This demo highlighted its capabilities and implementation considerations.
